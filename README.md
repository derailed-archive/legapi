# Discoursy
Discover your discourse.

Discoursy is supposed to be your go-to
discord alternative along with messenger
for the minority countries which still use
it massively (i.e. African Countries, the Philippines, etc.)

It's meant to be made to have better moderation,
API clarity, consistency, along with more and better features.

This repository houses it's API,
Web App, and Gateway. The desktop app will
later be put in another repository.
